#lists
"""
a list is a collection of items and to create a list we use square brackets [] and separate the items with commas.
lists are ordered, mutable, and allow duplicate elements. 
[] are used to define a list.
lists can contain elements of different data types, including other lists (nested lists).
lists are mutable, you can change, add, or remove elements after the list has been created.
